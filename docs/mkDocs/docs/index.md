# LiquidHaskell 

LiquidHaskell (_LH_) refines Haskell's types with logical 
predicates that let you enforce important properties at 
compile time. See [the blog](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/) 
for examples.

## Quick Start

Read the below for more details on how to:

* **Install** [external software](install.md) dependencies required by LH
* **Install** and use LH as a [GHC Plugin](plugin.md)
* Use the command line [options](options.md) supported by LH
* Write refinement type [specifications](specifications.md)

## Learn
